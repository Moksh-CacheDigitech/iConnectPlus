# Module catalog & primary flows (as built)

**Updated:** 2026-10-08  
**API mount:** `apps/api/src/shared/router.py` → `/api/v1`  
**UI registry:** `apps/web/src/config/modules.ts`

## 1. API modules (registered)

## 2. UI groups

| Group | Modules (href keys) |
|-------|---------------------|
| Foundation | foundation, email, voice-agent |
| Organization | organization |
| Master data | master-data |
| Operations | finance, sales, procurement, inventory, manufacturing, quality, crm, hr, payroll, recruitment, project, asset, service, helpdesk, document, marketing, grc, analytics, integration, ecommerce, portal |

ESS is primarily the employee-app / `/ess` surface, backed by `ess` + `hr` APIs.

## 3. Critical business flows

### 3.1 Procure-to-pay (simplified)

```text
Requisition → (workflow) → RFQ / Vendor quote → PO → GRN
        → stock via IInventoryStock → AP invoice → Finance payment
```

Approvals resolve through module governance → `resolve_workflow_definition_id`
(policy matrix + tenant setting override + default provision).

### 3.2 Order-to-cash

```text
CRM lead / opportunity → Quotation → Sales order → Delivery → Invoice
        → AR / journal posting via IFinancePosting
```

### 3.3 Inventory movement

```text
Reservation / transfer / adjustment / GRN / issue
        → InventoryStockAdapter → stock ledger
        → optional outbox domain.inventory.* → AnaInventoryMovementFact
```

### 3.4 Hire-to-retire

```text
Recruitment → Master employee → HR employment / leave / attendance
        → ESS self-service → Separation → F&F via payroll port
```

Master employee writes from other modules go through `EmployeeCommands`
or `EmployeeService`; reads use `EmployeeRead` published projection.

### 3.5 Asset lifecycle

```text
Register → Assignment / Transfer → Maintenance → Disposal / Revaluation
DC challan ↔ SCM (see docs/09_OPS/dc-challan-scm-contract.md)
```

### 3.6 Platform side effects

```text
Service action
  ├─ number via SSOT numbering
  ├─ start workflow if APPROVAL_POLICIES mode=workflow
  ├─ enqueue outbox (notify / audit / finance / integration / domain)
  └─ Celery drain → adapters → projections
```

## 4. Cross-module rules (enforced)

1. **No foreign ORM** outside `adapters/` / `ports/` (CI gate).  
2. **Master data:** read via `modules.master_data.published`; write via owner commands/services.  
3. **Finance & stock:** one posting path and one stock path (platform adapters).  
4. **Notify / audit:** prefer platform facades.  
5. **Secrets / PII:** encrypted column types; never log plaintext.

## 5. Where to change things

| Change | Location |
|--------|----------|
| New API route | Module `routers/` → thin → service |
| New permission | Module `permissions.py` (+ migration seed if needed) |
| New approval doc type | `platform/policies.py` + module `WORKFLOW_CODES` |
| New Celery beat job | Module `tasks.py` + `workers/celery_app.py` schedule; wrap with `system_job` if side-effecting |
| New UI module card | `apps/web/src/config/modules.ts` + app route |
| Schema | Alembic revision only |
